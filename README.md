This game uses the GE211 engine, which depends on the SDL library version 2, along with SDL2 plugin libraries SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, and SDL2_ttf. 

To run the game, you need to install the development versions of these packages, as appropriate for your operating system. Then, run the "fireboy_and_watergirl" configuration in some IDE like CLion.
